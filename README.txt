CodeSaber - My hand-crafted tool of choice for code exploration

C# only

Two varieties:

CodeSaber.exe
- Microsoft (R) Roslyn-based basic C# REPL
  (shout out to @glennblock for the inspiration)
- Scripts (no class/global type declaration required) or assemblies
- Verrry basic initial implementation but *mucho* room for growth

CodeSaber.Ice.exe
- csc.exe-based C# compiler
- Assembly-based only (due to csc.exe)
- Basic gist export

Roadmap
- Add gist export to REPL
- Color/syntax highlighting for REPL?
- Add script file save/import/execution support in REPL
- Expand github support in general
- Add file persistence in ICE
- Add nuget support?
